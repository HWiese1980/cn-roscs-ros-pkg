This repository is kind of a fork. I'm not the original author of this code. I've just imported it from Google Code 
because it looks abandoned since ROS Fuerte. I thought it might be a good idea to rescue the code. Sharing is caring... 
stuff like that...

Perhaps... who knows... if I'm up for it I'll take a deeper look into it and see what I can do with the code and maybe
port it to Indigo. Sounds interesting enough in my book to have a C#/.NET integration in ROS.
